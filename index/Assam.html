            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million. Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).

        1. India Gate â€“ Indiaâ€™s Largest War Memorial
    </h1>

    India Gate is one monument that defines Delhi or India for that matter. It was built in 1931 as a memorial for martyrs of World War I and war in Afghanistan. At Rajpath, the structure looks amazing in evening lights. The gardens that line the structure are a must visit among the sightseeing places in Delhi. This is one of the popular tourist places to visit in Delhi at night. 
    <br>
    <br>
If you are in Delhi on the Republic Day, you must visit India Gate Parade which is really a prestigious and the most ceremonious event of India. Lots of international guests and national leaders are present on the occasion and pay tribute to the freedom fighters and great leaders of the country.
<br>
<br>
Few Essential Tips:
<ul>
    <li>For the sightseeing tour at India Gate, the best time is from October to March. The weather is soothing this time to roam around.</li>
    <li>If you are having a family trip, go for a picnic near India Gate. Bring packaged or cooked food and have fun.</li>
    <li>Bus service is readily available to reach India Gate. Else, you can take rickshaw or shuttle rickshaw.</li>
